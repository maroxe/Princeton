#+BEGIN_DEFINITION
A polytope $\mathcal P = \{x |  Ax \le b\}$ is full dimensional if it has non empty enterior.
#+END_DEFINITION

#+BEGIN_Theorem
$\mathcal P$ is full dimensional iff there exist $\varepsilon > 0, x \in \mathbb R^n$ such that $Ax \le (1-\varepsilon) b$
#+END_Theorem

#+BEGIN_DEFINITION
A time varying polytope $(\mathcal P_t)_{t \in [-1, 1]} = \{x |  A(t)x \le b\}$ is full dimensional if it has $\mathcal P_t$ is full dimensional for all $t \in [-1, 1]$.
#+END_DEFINITION

#+BEGIN_Theorem
$\mathcal P_t$ is full dimensional iff there exist $\varepsilon > 0, x \in \mathbb R^n$ such that $A(t)x(t) \le (1-\varepsilon) b$
